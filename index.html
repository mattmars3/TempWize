            <p>
                Sometimes, the body has a hard time controlling its temperature throughout the night leading to
                night sweats and waking up from being too hot or cold. This interruption contributes to a lack of sleep,
                taking a toll on daytime life. This problem calls for a product that can adapt to your body's temperature,
                preventing these uncomfortable sleep interruptions, and giving you a better night's sleep.
